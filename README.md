# ClimateWins
This project was created as part of a Data Analytics Immersion course. On it I dive into the available data to answer key business questions.

## ClimateWins Analysis
### Introduction
Congratulations! You’ve been hired as a data analyst by a European nonprofit organization, ClimateWins. Because ClimateWins is a nonprofit, it doesn’t have a lot of funds to hire a dedicated data scientist and engineering team. This means you’ll have a chance to train on some more advanced topics and do some work normally done by data scientists. CimateWins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. It’s been sorting through hurricane predictions from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of other data. However, it’s hard to grasp how everything is changing in the world at once. This is where machine learning comes in! Because ClimateWins is still a small organization without a lot of resources, you’ll be working as a data analyst, data scientist, researcher, and trainee all at the same time to help them with this project. The first task you’ll tackle is getting up to speed with machine learning methods, then identifying the best resources for predicting climate changes where people live. Machine learning is traditionally created and used by data scientists, so this is an excellent opportunity to further your knowledge as a data analyst and get experience with more complex projects. You’ll first have to determine which areas can use machine learning. Next, you’ll look at data that already includes answers so that machine learning can be trained to recognize similar answers (supervised learning). Then you’ll clearly communicate what you found (your results) and how they’ll affect ClimateWins’ strategy. After you’ve identified the best models to use in Achievement 1, you’ll put them to use in Achievement 2 as you work with ClimateWins’ data and start making predictions.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on the inventory, customers and transactions of Rockbuster in a PostrgreSQL database format.

### Key Questions to answer
- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)
